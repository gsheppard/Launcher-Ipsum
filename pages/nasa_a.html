within design limits. Ablating materials absorb heat by increasing
in temperature and changing in chemical or physical state. The
heat is carried away from the surface by a loss of mass (liquid
or vapor). The departing mass also blocks part of the convective
heat transfer to the remaining material in the same manner as

Although it was already obvious on the occasion of the 8th CGPM (1933) that there was a unanimous desire to replace those "international" units by so-called "absolute" units, the official decision to abolish them was only taken by the 9th CGPM (1948), which adopted for the unit of electric current, the <A HREF="a.html#ampere">ampere</A>," which see.

system is maintained. Infrared radiation emitted by the earth's
surface (terrestrial radiation) is partially absorbed by the water
vapor of the atmosphere which in turn remits it, partly upward,
partly downward. This secondarily emitted radiation is then, in
general, repeatedly absorbed and reemitted, as the radiant energy
progresses through the atmosphere. The downward flux, or counterradiation,

accelerations, the lightning channel acts like a huge transmitter,
sending out broad band radiation; the 10-kilocycle range propagates
best and is used in detecting atmospherics. Atmospherics may occasionally
be detected at distances in excess of 2000 miles from their source.
Advantage has been taken of this in using radio direction-finding
equipment to locate active thunderstorm areas in remote regions

<A NAME="atmospheric shell"></A>
<DT><STRONG>atmospheric shell</STRONG> 
<DD>Any one of a number of strata or layers of the earth's atmosphere.
Also called  <I> atmospheric layer, atmospheric region </I> .
<DD> <I> Temperature distribution is the most common criterion used
for denoting the various shells. The troposphere (the region of
change) is the lowest 10 or 20 kilometers of the atmosphere, characterized
by decreasing temperature with height. The top of the troposphere
is called the tropopause. Above the tropopause, the stratosphere,
a region in which the temperature generally increases with altitude,
extends to the 
<A NAME="stratopause">stratopause</A>, the top of the inversion layer, at
about 50 to 55 kilometers. Above the stratosphere, the mesosphere,
a region of generally decreasing temperatures with height extends
to the mesopause, the base of an inversion layer at about 80 to
85 kilometers. The region above the mesopause, in which temperature
generally increases with height, is the thermosphere. 
<BR>The distribution
of various physicochemical processes is another criterion. The
ozonosphere, lying roughly between 10 and 50 kilometers, is the
general region of the upper atmosphere in which there is an appreciable
ozone concentration and in which ozone plays an important part
in the radiative balance of the atmosphere; the ionosphere, starting
at about 70 or 80 kilometers, is the region in which ionization
of one or more of the atmospheric constituents is significant;
the neutrosphere is the shell below this which is, by contrast,
relatively unionized; and the chemosphere, with no very definite
height limits, is the region in which photochemical reactions
take place. 
<BR>Dynamic and kinetic processes are a third criterion.
The exosphere is the region at the top of the atmosphere, above
the critical level of escape, in which atmospheric particles can
move in free orbits, subject only to the earth's gravitation.
<BR>Composition is a fourth criterion. The homosphere is the shell
in which there is so little photodissociation or gravitational
separation that the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere is
sensibly constant; the heterosphere is the region above this,
where the atmospheric composition and mean molecular weight are
not constant. The boundary between the two is probably at the
level at which molecular oxygen begins to be dissociated, and
this occurs in the vicinity of 80 or 90 kilometers. 
<BR>The term mesosphere
has been given another definition which does not fit into any
logical set of criteria, i.e., the shell between the exosphere
and the ionosphere. This use of mesosphere has not been widely
accepted.

<A HREF="#airglow">airglow</A>.
<DD> <I> According to various theories, auroras seem definitely
to be related to magnetic storms and the influx of charged particles
from the sun. The exact details of the nature of the mechanisms
involved are still being investigated, but release of trapped
particles from Van Allen belt apparently plays an important part.
The aurora is most intense at times of magnetic storms (when it
is also observed farthest equatorward), and shows a periodicity
which is related to the sun's 27-day rotation period and the 11-year
sunspot cycle. The distribution with height shows a pronounced
maximum near 100 kilometers. The lower limit is probably near
80 kilometers. 
<BR>The aurora can often be clearly seen, and it assumes
a variety of shapes and colors which are characteristic patterns
of auroral emission. 
<BR>The following is the general classification
and abbreviations of the forms of the auroras adopted by the International
Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in 1930 for reporting of visual
observations. The classification was modified slightly and expanded
in 1963. The new classification is described in the  </I> <CITE>International
Auroral Atlas</CITE> <I> , Aldine Pub. Co., Chicago, 1963.  </I> <P>
<DD>I. Forms without ray structure: 
<BR>HA (abbr for homogeneous quiet
area). These can appear near the horizon, and between the arc
and the horizon a dark segment is often seen. These arcs can be
narrow or broad, and are very often diffuse along the upper border
but sharp along the lower one. 
<BR>HB (abbr for homogeneous bands).
These forms do not have the regular shape of the arcs; they are
more rapidly moving phenomena. The lower border is often irregular
and sharp. The breadth can vary from a very narrow band to a band
which is so large that it resembles a curtain hanging down. These
bands very often turn into bands with ray structure. 
<BR>PA (abbr for pulsating arcs). Parts of an arc flash up and disappear regularly
within a period of about 20 seconds. This form quite often stands
isolated in the sky without other auroras. 
<BR>DS (abbr for diffuse luminous surfaces). These either appear like a diffuse veil or
glow over great parts of the heavens without distinct boundaries,
often appearing after intense displays of rays and curtains, or
as more isolated feeble luminous streaks which sometimes bear
a striking resemblance to clouds. Sometimes large areas of the
heavens can be discolored by a green, violet, or red diffuse light.
<BR>PS (abbr for pulsating surfaces). Diffuse patches appear and disappear
rhythmically at the same place, retaining the same irregular shape,
When the patches are lying near the magnetic zenith the contours
can be more sharp, and form a sort of corona. These forms appear
often in connection with flaming auroras. 
<BR>G (abbr for feeble glow
near the horizon resembling the dawn). Of white or redlike color,
this form is often the upper part of an arc whose lower border
is below the horizon.<P>
<DD>II. Forms with ray structure: These forms consist of short
or long rays which can be arranged in different ways. 
<BR>RA (abbr for arcs with ray structure). A homogeneous arc which has remained
quiet and unaltered for a rather long time may become sharp and
luminous along the lower border and they very rapidly change into
an arc of rays. The rays can be short or long. 
<BR>RBI (abbr for bands
with ray structure). These resemble the bands mentioned under
HB but are constituted of a series of rays which are arranged
close to each other along the band, or they can appear more scattered.
Often a series of parallel bands appear. When a band is near the
magnetic zenith is may have the form of a corona. 
<BR>D (abbr for draperies). If the ray become very long the band appears like
a curtain or drapery whose lower border is often more luminous.
Several parallel curtains frequently appear at the same time.
Near the zenith the curtain may have a fanlike form on account
of the perspective. 
<BR>R (abbr for rays). The rays can be isolated,
narrow or broad, short or long. They may appear in great segments
or like masses or rays, very often resembling curtains. 
<BR>C (abbr for corona). When the rays approach the magnetic zenith they seem,
on account of the perspective, to converge to this point and form
a corona. This may be formed by long rays or by short ones, it
may be completed or incomplete. A corona can also be formed by
bands, draperies, or more diffuse forms near the magnetic zenith.
<P>
<DD>III. Flaming auroras (abbr F). A characteristic, rapidly moving
form, consisting of strong waves of light which move upwards,
one after the other, in the direction of the magnetic zenith.
The waves have the form of detached arcs which move upwards normally
to the direction of the arc; they can be compared to invisible
waves illuminating broad rays and patches which appear and disappear
rhythmically when the waves pass them. The flaming aurora frequently
appears after strong displays of rays and curtains and is often
followed by the formation of a corona. <P>

half of Hudson Bay, slightly off the southern tip of Greenland,
through Iceland, northern Norway and northern Siberia. Along this
line auroras are seen on an average of 240 nights a year. The
frequency of auroras falls off both to the north and to the south
of this line but more rapidly to the south. The most severe blackouts
occur in the auroral zone. </I>

<DT><STRONG>axis (plural axes)</STRONG> 
<DD>1. A straight line about which a body rotates, or along which
its center of gravity moves (axis of translation). 
<DD>2. A straight line around which a plane figure may rotate
to produce a solid; a line of symmetry. 
<DD>3. One of a set of reference lines for a 
<A HREF="c.html#coordinate">coordinate</A>
system.
<A NAME="axis of freedom"></A>
<DT><STRONG>axis of freedom</STRONG> 
<DD>Of a <A HREF="g.html#gyro">gyro</A>, an axis about which a 
<A HREF="g.html#gimbal">gimbal</A> provides a
<A HREF="d.html#degree of freedom">degree of freedom</A>.
<DT><STRONG>axis of thrust</STRONG> = <A HREF="t.html#thrust axis">thrust axis</A>. 
<A NAME="azimuth"></A>
<DT><STRONG>azimuth</STRONG> 
<DD>1. Horizontal direction or 
<A HREF="b.html#bearing">bearing</A>. Compare 
<A HREF="#azimuth angle">azimuth angle</A>.
<DD>2. In navigation, the horizontal direction of a 
<A HREF="c.html#celestial">celestial</A>
point from a 
<A HREF="t.html#terrestrial">terrestrial</A> point, expressed as the angular
distance from a reference direction, usually measured from 0&#176;
at the reference direction clockwise through 360&#176;.
<DD> <I> An azimuth is often designated as true, magnetic, compass,
grid, or relative as the reference direction is true, magnetic,
compass, grid north, or heading, respectively. Unless otherwise
specified, the term is generally understood to apply to true azimuth,
which may be further defined as the arc of the horizon, or the
angle at the zenith, between the north part of the celestial 
<A HREF="m.html#meridian">meridian</A>
or principal vertical circle and a vertical circle, measured from
0&#176; at the north part of the principal vertical circle clockwise
through 360&#176;.  </I> 
<DD>3. In astronomy, the direction of a celestial point from a
terrestrial point measured clockwise from the north or the south
point of the 
<A HREF="m.html#meridian">meridian</A> plane. See 
<A HREF="h.html#horizon system">horizon system</A>.
<DD>4. In surveying, the horizontal direction of an object measured
clockwise from the <I>  south point of the meridian plane.<BR> In
surveying, an azimuth of a celestial body is called an astronomic
azimuth. </I>
<A NAME="azimuth angle"></A>
<DT><STRONG>azimuth angle</STRONG> 
<DD>1. Azimuth measured from 0&#176; at the north or south reference
direction clockwise or counterclockwise through 90&#176; or
180&#176;.
<DD> <I> Azimuth angle is labeled with the reference direction as
a prefix and the direction of measurement from the reference direction
as a suffix. Thus, azimuth angle S 144&#176; W is 144&#176;
west of south, or azimuth 324&#176;. When azimuth angle is measured
through 180&#176;, it is labeled N or S to agree with the latitude
and E or W to agree with the meridian angle. </I>  
<DD>2. In surveying, an angle in triangulation or in traverse
through which the computation of azimuth is carried.
<A NAME="azimuth error"></A>
<DT><STRONG>azimuth error</STRONG> 
<DD>An error in the indicated <A HREF="#azimuth">azimuth</A> of a target detected by
radar, resulting from horizontal <A HREF="r.html#refraction">refraction</A>. Compare <A HREF="r.html#range error">range error</A>.
<DD> <I> Inasmush as significant gradients of 
<A HREF="i.html#index of refraction">index of refraction</A>
are very uncommon in the atmosphere, these errors almost invariably
are negligible. Seacoast areas may give rise on occasion to appreciable
horizontal bending of radio waves because of the contrast of refractive
index values between the air over land and the air over water. </I> 
<A NAME="azimuth marker"></A>
<DT><STRONG>azimuth marker</STRONG> 
<DD>1. A scale encircling the plan position indicator (PPI) scope
of a <A HREF="r.html#radar">radar</A> on which the <A HREF="#azimuth">azimuth</A> of a target from the radar may
be measured.
<DD>2. Reference limits inserted electronically at 10&#176; or 15&#176;
intervals which extend radially from the relative position of
the radar on an off center PPI scope. These are employed for target
azimuth determination when the radar position is not at the center
of the PPI scope and hence the fixed azimuth scale on the edge
of the scope cannot be employed.
<DD> <I> On such markers north is usually 0&#176;, east 90&#176;,
etc. Occasionally, on ship or airborne radars, 0&#176; is used
to indicate the direction in which the craft is heading, in which
cases the relative bearing, not azimuth, of the target is indicated. </I> 
<DT><STRONG>azran</STRONG> 
<DD><I>Az</I>imuth and <I>ran</I>ge.
<DD> <I> This term was coined in the field of radar, and has since
been extended in application to the locating of any object (or
target) by means of polar coordinates. </I>  
<A NAME="azusa"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Azusa</STRONG> 
<DD>A short-baseline, continuous wave, phase comparison, single-station,
tracking system operating at C-band and giving two <A HREF="d.html#direction cosines">direction cosines</A>
and <A HREF="s.html#slant range">slant range</A> which can be used to determine space position
and velocity.
