  terminology used. Probably the most easily understood system is the eyeballs 
  in, eyeballs out, eyeballs down, eyeballs up, etc., terminology used by test 
  pilots, which refers to the sensations experienced by the person being 
  accelerated. Thus, the acceleration experienced in an aircraft pullout or 
  inside loop is eyeballs down. Note that, in the NASA vehicle (center of 
  gravity displacement) terminology, this is -az acceleration. Some 
  physiological-acceleration terminologies designate accelerations in terms of 
  the equivalent displacement acceleration of the subject as if he were starting 
  from rest. In such terminologies a man standing up or sitting down on the 
  surface of the earth is experiencing 1 g of headward acceleration because of 
  gravity. Other descriptive terms used in this way are footward, forward (the 
  acceleration experienced by a man pressed into the seat back by an 
  accelerating vehicle), rearward, leftward, rightward, spineward, sternumward, 
  and tailward. One terminology based on reaction uses the terms head-to-foot 
  (the acceleration generated by a pullout in an aircraft), chest-to-back, 
  foot-to-head, and back-to-chest. </I>

  negative, divided by the area of the surface. 
  <DD><I>In general, it is assumed that the area of the imaginary plane surface 
  is small enough so that the pressure with respect to any part of the surface 
  is equal (within narrow limits) to the pressure based on the whole surface. 
  Different kinds of pressure (static, dynamic, partial, total, vapor, etc.)

  velocity vectors or by the restriction to a specified set of molecular species 
  crossing the imaginary surface. </I>

  mass-flow vectors in the gas (which is seldom at rest), and errors due to 
  variations in wall temperatures of tube and system are frequently neglected. 
  The actual total pressure in a high-vacuum system cannot usually be measured

  <DD>1. A variation of a quantity whose value is normally constant; this

  <DD><I>The word pulse normally refers to a variation in time; when the 
  variation is in some other dimensions, it should be so specified, such as 
  space pulse. This definition is so broad that it covers almost any transient 
  phenomenon. The only features common to all pulses are rise, finite duration, 
  and decay. It is necessary that the rise, duration, and decay be of a quantity 
  that is constant (not necessarily zero) for sometime before the pulse and has 
  the same constant value for some time afterwards. The quantity has a normally 
  constant value and is perturbed during the pulse. No relative time scale can 
  be assigned. </I>
