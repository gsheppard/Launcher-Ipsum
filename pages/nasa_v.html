  outer product. </I>See <A

  directed that a right-hand rotation about A X B through an angle of not more 
  than 180 degrees carries A into B. The magnitude of A X B is equal to twice 
  the area of the triangle of which A and B are coterminous sides. IF the vector 
  product is zero, one of the vectors is zero or else the two are parallel. When
