  There is no sharp line of demarcation between true solutions and colloidal 
  system on the one hand, or between mere suspensions and colloidal systems on 
  the other. When the particles of the dispersed phase are smaller than about 1 
  millimicron in diameter, the system begins to assume the properties of a true 
  solution; when the particles dispersed are much greater than 1 micron, 
  separation of the dispersed phase from the dispersing medium becomes so rapid

  absorption becomes proportional to the square root of the number of atoms or

  <DD>A system of <A

  coordinates</A> in which the position of a point in space is determined by (a) 
  its perpendicular distance from a given line, (b) its distance from a selected

  a selected reference line when projected onto this plane. The coordinates thus 
  form the elements of a cylinder, and, in the usual notation, are written, 
  <I>r</I>, <IMG src="thetasm.gif">, and <I>z</I> where <I>r</I> is the
