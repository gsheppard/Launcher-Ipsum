  <DD><I>Scanning usually follows a systematic pattern involving one or more of 
  the following: (1) In horizontal scanning (or searchlighting), the antenna is 
  continuously rotated in azimuth around the horizon or in a sector (sector 
  scanning); used to generate plan-position-indicator-scope displays. (b) 
  Vertical scanning is accomplished by holding the azimuth constant but varying 
  the elevation angle of the antenna; used in height-finding radars to generate 
  the relative-height-indicator-scope display. (c) For conical scanning, a 
  somewhat offcenter radiating element is rotated while its parabolic reflectors 
  fixed in position so that the radiated beam generates a concially shaped 
  volume with the antenna at the apex; used to determine accurate bearing and 
  elevation angle of targets and employed in automatic tracking radars. (d) In 
  helical scanning (or spiral scanning) the azimuth and elevation angle of the 
  antenna are constantly varied so that at a given distance from the radar the 
  radiated beam generates the surface of a hemisphere; used for radio direction 
  finding, in certain types of search radars, and in tracking radars to search 
  areas for targets. </I>

  <DD>1. Generic term for rapid variations in apparent position, brightness, or

  href="a.html#atmosphere">atmosphere</A>. 
  <DD><I>If the object lies outside the earth's atmosphere, as in the case of 
  stars and planets, the phenomenon is termed astronomical scintillation; if the 
  luminous source lies within the atmosphere, the phenomenon is termed 
  terrestrial scintillation. As one of the three principal factors governing 
  astronomical seeing, scintillation is defined as variations in <A 
  href="l.html#luminance">luminance</A> 
  only. It is clearly established that almost all scintillation effects are 
  caused by anomalous refraction occurring in rather small parcels or strata of 
  air, schlieren, whose temperatures and hence densities differ slightly from 
  those of their surroundings. Normal wind motions transporting such schlieren 
  across the observer's line of sight produce the irregular fluctuations 
  characteristic of scintillation. Scintillation effects are always much more 
  pronounced near the horizon than near the zenith. Parcels of the order of only 
  centimeters to decimeters are believed to produce most of the scintillatory 
  irregularities in the atmosphere. </I>

  <DD>The unit of time, the second, was defined originally as the fraction 1/86 
  400 of the mean solar day. The exact definition of the "mean solar day" was 
  left to astronomers, but their measurements have shown that on account of 
  irregularities in the rotation of the Earth, the mean solar day does not 
  guarantee the desired accuracy. In order to define the unit of time more 
  precisely, the 11th CGPM (1960) adopted a definition given by the 
  International Astronomical Union which was based on the tropical year [see <A 
  href="e.html#ephemeris second">ephemeris 
  second</A>]. Experimental work had, however, already shown that an atomic 
  standard of time-interval, based on a transition between two energy levels of 
  an atom or a molecule, could be realized and reproduced much more accurately. 
  Considering that a very precise definition of the unit of time of the 
  International System, the second, is indispensable for the needs of advanced 
  metrology, the 13th CGPM (1967) decided to replaced the definition of the 
  second by the following:

  numbered, as 1961o2. (Space probes were not included in this system until 
  1960). Beginning January 1, 1963, arabic numerals supplanted Greek letters in 
  the scientific designations of all spacecraft with a lifetime of more than 90 
  minutes. Thus, the first satellite launched in 1963 was 1963-1, the last was 
  1963-55. When more than one component is put in orbit, alphabetical suffixes 
  are added to the designations, as 1963-4A. The letter A usually designates the 
  component carrying the principle scientific payload; B, C, etc., are used as 
  needed for any subsidiary payloads and then for inert components in order of 
  maximum brightness. The designation system was promulgated formally in the

  <DD><I>The following are the most important effects accompanying a sudden 
  ionospheric disturbance: (a) radio fadeout, a condition in which there is a 
  marked and abrupt increase in absorption in the D-region for high frequency 
  radio waves (2 to 3 megacycles) and a consequent loss of long-distance radio 
  reception in this range of frequencies; (b) magnetic crotchet, a sudden change 
  in the earth's magnetic field due to an increase in the conductivity of the 
  lower ionosphere, the change being in the nature of an augmentation of the 
  normal quiet-day magnetic change; (c) sudden enhancements of long-wave 
  atmospherics recorded in the frequency range between 10 and 100 kilocycles due 
  to the improved reflectivity at oblique incidence of the D-region for such 
  low-frequency radio waves; (d) sudden phase anomalies of discrete 
  low-frequency radio waves (10 to 100 kilocycles) due to descent of the 
  D-layer; and (e) sudden field-strength anomalies of distant low-frequency 
  radio signals (10 to 100 kilocycles) due to interference between the 
  groundwave and the skywave. A sudden ionospheric disturbance usually occurs a 
  few minutes after a solar flare and is noted only on the sunlit side of the 
  earth. The return of the ionosphere to its normal condition following a

  propagation</A>. 
  <DD><I>Superstandard propagation produces a greater-than-normal downward 
  bending of radio waves as they travel through the atmosphere, giving extended 
  radio horizons and increased radar coverage. It results primarily from 
  propagation through layers near the earth's surface in which the moisture 
  lapse rate is greater than normal, or the temperature lapse rate less than 
  normal, or both. A condition in which warn dry air moves out over a cool water 
  surface is an example of superrefraction. A layer in which the downward 
  bending is greater than the curvature of the earth is called a radio duct. 
  Frequently, the general term, anomalous propagation, is used for superstandard 
  propagation. </I>
