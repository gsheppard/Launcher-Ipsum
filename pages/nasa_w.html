  <DD><I>This signal apparently propagates along a geomagnetic line of force and

  name="whistling meteor"></A>
  <DT><STRONG>whistling meteor</STRONG> 
  <DD>Name applied to a <A

  meteor</A> when a detection system is used in which the presence of the meteor 
  is indicated by a rapidly changing <A

  radio signal. 
  <DD><I>The maximum reflection of a radio signal from a radio meteor occurs 
  when the ion column is perpendicular to the line from the column to the 
  transmitter-receiver. During the approach of the meteor to this position, the 
  Doppler effect causes a change in the frequency of the reflected signal. When 
  the reflected signal frequency is then combined with the transmitter 
  frequency, the difference between the transmitted and reflected frequencies 
  produces an audiofrequency beat. The audiofrequency beat, when amplified and 
  fed to a loudspeaker, allows the meteors to be heard as a high-pitched whistle 
  which rapidly falls to zero frequency as the meteor trail becomes normal to 
  the line of sight. </I><A name="white body"></A>

  for all wavelengths; an idealization exactly opposite to that of the black 
  body. See <A href="g.html#gray body">gray 
  body</A>. 
  <DD><I>In nature, no true white bodies are known. Most white pigments 
  possessing high reflectivity for visible radiation are fairly good absorbers 
  in the infrared; hence, they are not white bodies in the sense of the 
  radiation theory. However, the term white body is used for physical objects 
  with respect to a particular wavelength interval. </I><A

  displacement constant b is equal to 0.28978 centimeter-degree. Also called 
  <I>Wien displacement law </I>. 
  <DD><I>This law, established experimentally by Wien in 1896, describes the 
  manner in which the wavelength of maximum radiation shifts toward shorter

  distribution law</A> which describes the variation with temperature of the

  compute the color temperature of a radiator by insertion of its wavelength of
