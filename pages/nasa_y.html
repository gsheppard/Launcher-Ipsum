  <DT><STRONG>yaw</STRONG> 
  <DD>1. The rotational or oscillatory movement of an aircraft, rocket, or the 
  like about a vertical axis.

  <DT><STRONG>yaw angle</STRONG> = angle of yaw. 
  <DT><STRONG>yaw axis</STRONG> 
  <DD>A vertical <A

  <DT><STRONG>year</STRONG> 
  <DD>A period of one revolution of the earth around the sun. 
  <DD><I>The period of one revolution with respect to the vernal equinox, 
  averaging 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45.68 seconds in 1955, is called a 
  tropical, astronomical, equinoctial, natural, or solar year. The period with 
  respect to the stars, averaging 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9.55 seconds in 
  1955, is called a sidereal year. The period of revolution from perihelion to 
  perihelion, averaging 365 days 6 hours 13 minutes 53.16 seconds in 1955, is an 
  anomalistic year. The period between successive returns of the sun to a 
  sidereal hour angle of 80 degrees is called a fictitious or Besselian year. A 
  civil year is the calendar year of 365 days in common years, or 366 days in 
  leap years. A light year is a unit of length equal to the distance light 
  travels in one year, 9.460 X 10E12 kilometers. The term year is occasionally 
  applied to other intervals such as an eclipse year, the interval between two 
  successive conjunctions of the sun with the same node of the moon's orbit, a 
  period averaging 346 days 14 hours 52 minutes 52.23 seconds in 1955, or a 
  great or Platonic year, the period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes 
  around the ecliptic, about 25,800 years.</I>
