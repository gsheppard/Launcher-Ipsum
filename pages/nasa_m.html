  <DD><I>Magnetic storms are frequently characterized by a sudden onset, in

  nature of the link between the solar and terrestrial disturbances is not 
  understood. They are more frequent during years of high sunspot number. 
  Sometimes a magnetic storm can be linked to a particular solar disturbance. In 
  these cases, the time between solar flare and onset of the magnetic storm is 
  about 1 or 2 days, suggesting that the disturbance is carried to the earth by 
  a cloud of particles thrown out by the sun. <BR>When these disturbances are

  The most commonly seen is the inferior mirage over heated surfaces, which 
  often looks like a pool of water because it reflects the sky. Superior 
  mirages, which appear above the direct image of the object, are due to strong 
  thermal inversions above eye level. Other mirage-like images can be produced 
  by thermal inversions below eye level, and by hot air adjacent to a wall 
  heated by the Sun (lateral mirage).

  mirage, the superior mirage, or the lateral mirage, depending, respectively, 
  on whether the spurious image appears below, above, or to one side of the true 
  position of the object. Of the three, the inferior mirage is the most common, 
  being usually discernible over any heated street in daytime during summer. The 
  abnormal refraction responsible for mirages is invariably associated with 
  abnormal temperature distributions that yield abnormal spatial variations in 
  the refractive index.</I> <A name=miran></A>
