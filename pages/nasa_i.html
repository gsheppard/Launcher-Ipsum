  capable of absorbing or emitting infrared radiation, but several of the

  <DD><I>In automatically sequenced computers, the instruction code is used when 
  describing or expressing sequences of instructions, and each instruction word 
  usually contains a part specifying the operation to be performed and one or 
  more addresses which identify a particular location in storage. Sometimes, an 
  address part of an instruction is not intended to specify a location in 
  storage but is used for some other purpose. If more than one address is used, 
  the code is called a multiple-address code. In a typical instruction of a 
  four-address code, the addresses specify the location of two operands, the 
  destination of the result, and the location of the next instruction in the 
  sequence. In a typical three-address code, the fourth address specifying the 
  location of the next instruction is dispensed with and the instructions are 
  taken from storage in a preassigned order. In a typical one-address or 
  single-address code, the address may specify either the location of an operand 
  to be taken from storage, the destination of a previously prepared result, or 
  the location of the next instruction. The arithmetic element usually contains 
  at least two storage locations, one of which is an accumulator. For example, 
  operations requiring two operands may obtain one operand from the main storage 
  and the other from a storage location in the arithmetic element which is 
  specified by the operation part. </I>

  electron) having charges of the same magnitude and formed from a neutral atom 
  or molecule by the action of radiation. In spectroscopy, the degree of 
  ionization of an atom is indicated by a Roman numeral following the symbol for

  and <A href="l.html#large ions">large 
  ions</A>, although a class of intermediate ions has occasionally been 
  reported. 
  <DD><I>The ionization process which forms small ions depends upon two distinct 
  agencies, cosmic rays and radioactive emanations. Each of these consists of 
  very energetic particles which ionize neutral air molecules by knocking out 
  one or more planetary electrons. The resulting free electron and positively 
  charged molecule (or atom) very quickly attach themselves to one or, at most, 
  a small number of neutral air molecules, thereby forming new small ions. In 
  the presence of Aitken nuclei, some the small ions will in turn attach 
  themselves to these nuclei, thereby creating new large ions. The two main 
  classes of ions differ widely in mobility. Only the highly mobile small ions 
  contribute significantly to the electrical conductivity of the air under most 
  conditions. The intermediate ions and large ions are important in certain 
  space charge effects, but are too sluggish to contribute much to conductivity.

  <DD><I>The ionosphere is classically subdivided into layers. Each layer, 
  except the D-layer, is supposedly characterized by a more or less regular 
  maximum of electron density. The D-layer exists only in the daytime. It is not 
  strictly a layer at all, since it does not exhibit a peak of electron or ion 
  density, starting at about 70 to 80 kilometers and merging with the bottom of 
  the E-layer. The lowest clearly defined layer is the E-layer, occurring 
  between 100 and 120 kilometers. The F1-layer and F2-layer occur in the general 
  region between 150 and 300 kilometers, the F2-layer being always present and 
  having the higher electron density. The existence of a G-layer has been 
  suggested, but is questionable. The portions of the ionosphere in which these 
  layers tend to form are known as ionosphere in which these layers tend to form 
  are known as ionospheric regions, as in D-region, E-region, F-region, 
  G-region. Sudden increases in ionization are referred to as sporadic, as in 
  sporadic E or sporadic D. The above assumption that the ionosphere is 
  stratified in the vertical into discrete layers is currently under serious 
  question. Some evidence supports a belief that ion clouds are the basic 
  elements of the ionosphere. Other investigations appear to reveal the
