  ranges than do alpha and beta particles, often amounting to distances of the 
  order of a hundred meters in air at sea level. These high-energy photons may

  subject to, or capable of, some degree of guidance or direction after having 
  been launched, fired, or otherwise set in motion. 
  <DD>2. Specifically, an unmanned, self-propelled flying vehicle (such as a 
  pilotless aircraft or rocket) carrying a destructive load and capable of being 
  directed or of directing itself after launching or take-off, responding either 
  to external direction or to direction originating from devices within the 
  missile itself. 
  <DD>3. Loosely, by extension, any steerable projectile. See <A

  missile</A>. 
  <DT><STRONG>guiding center</STRONG> 
  <DD>The center point of the <A 
  href="l.html#larmor orbit">Larmor 
  orbit</A> of a charged particle gyrating in a magnetic field. 
  <DD><I>It is often convenient to separate the total motion of a particle into 
  the Larmor orbit plus the motion of the guiding center. In addition to the 
  unimpeded motion of the guiding center of a particle along the magnetic field, 
  the presence of electric fields will displace the guiding center perpendicular 
  to the magnetic field. </I>
  <DT><STRONG>gust tunnel</STRONG> 
  <DD>A <A href="w.html#wind tunnel">wind 
  tunnel</A> in which gusts are simulated. Specifically, a tunnel in which 
  models are passed over a vertical jet or jets simulating gusts. <A

  <DT><STRONG>gyro</STRONG> 
  <DD>1. A device which utilizes the angular momentum of a spinning mass (rotor) 
  to sense angular motion of its base about one or two axes orthogonal to the 
  spin axis. Also called <I>gyroscope. </I>
  <DD><I>This definition does not include more complex systems such as <A
