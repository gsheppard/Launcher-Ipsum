  principal electric and magnetic polarization planes. Also called <I>antenna 
  pattern, lobe pattern, coverage diagram. </I>
  <DD><I>Two types of radiation patterns should be distinguished. They are: (a) 
  the free-space radiation pattern which is the complete lobe pattern of the 
  antenna and is a function of the wavelength, feed system, and reflector 
  characteristics, and (b) the field radiation pattern which differs primarily 
  from the free-space pattern by the formation of interference lobes whenever 
  direct and reflected wave trains interfere with each other as is found in most

  radiation field is changes, and is exactly twice as great when the radiation 
  is reflected at normal incidence as it is when the radiation is entirely 
  absorbed at normal incidence. The magnitude of any radiation-pressure effect

  not necessarily by radiation only. 
  <DD><I>Generally, the application of the terms radiator (in sense 2) or heat 
  exchanger to a particular apparatus depends upon the point of view: If the 
  emphasis is upon merely getting rid of heat, radiator is most often used, or 
  sometimes cooler; if the emphasis is upon transferring heat, heat exchanger is 
  used -- but these distinctions do not always hold true. </I><A name=radio></A>
