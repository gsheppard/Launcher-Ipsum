  <DD><I>Beginning with the volume for 1960 the American Ephemeris and Nautical 
  Almanac uses ephemeris time as the tabular argument in the fundamental 
  ephemerides of the sun, moon, and planets. <BR>A gravitational ephemeris 
  expresses the position of a celestial body as a function of ephemeris time; 
  and, at any instant, the measure of ephemeris time is the value of the 
  argument at which the ephemeris position is the same as the actual position at 
  the instant. The ephemeris time at any instant is obtained from observation by 
  directly comparing observed position of the sun, moon, and planets with 
  gravitational ephemerides of their coordinates; observations of the moon are 
  the most effective and expeditious for this purpose. An accurate 
  determination, however, requires observations over a more or less extended 
  period; in practice, it takes the form of determining the time correction <IMG
