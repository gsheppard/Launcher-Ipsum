  <DT><STRONG>first law of thermodynamics</STRONG> 
  <DD>A statement of the conservation of energy for <A 
  href="t.html#thermodynamic">thermodynamic</A> 
  systems (not necessarily in equilibrium). The fundamental form requires that 
  the heat absorbed by the system serve either to raise the internal energy of 
  the system or to do work on the environment: 
  <CENTER><I>dq </I>= <I>du </I>+ <I>dw </I></CENTER>where <I>dq </I>is the heat 
  added per unit mass; <I>du </I>is the increment of specific internal energy; 
  and <I>dw </I>is the specific work done by the system on the environment. 
  Although <I>dq </I>and <I>dw </I>are not perfect differentials, their 
  difference, <I>du</I>, is always a perfect differential. Example of the 
  application of this equation: in an adiabatic free expansion of gas into a 
  vacuum, all three terms are zero. 
  <DD><I>For reversible processes the mechanical work is equal to the expansion 
  against the pressure forces, i.e., 
  <CENTER>dw = pdv </CENTER>where p is the pressure and v is the specific 
  volume. For a perfect gas, the internal energy change is proportional to the 
  temperature change, 
  <CENTER>du = c<SUB>v</SUB>dT</CENTER>where c<SUB>v</SUB> is the specific heat 
  at constant volume and T is the Kelvin temperature. Therefore, the form of the 
  first law usually used in meteorological applications is 
  <CENTER>dq = c<SUB>v</SUB>dT + pdv</CENTER>Use of the equation of state yields 
  an alternative form, 
  <CENTER>dq = c<SUB>p</SUB>dT - dp</CENTER>where c<SUB>p</SUB> is the specific 
  heat at constant pressure. <BR>For open systems the variation of total rather 
  than specific quantities is important: 
  <CENTER>dQ = dU + pdV - hdm</CENTER>where Q is the total heat; U is the total 
  internal energy; V is the volume; m is the mass of the system; and h is the 
  specific enthalpy. <BR>If a system contains the possibility of nonmechanical 
  work, such as work done against an electric field, this work must be included 
  in the first law. <BR>See <A

  arriving at the receiver from any point along any of the surface Fresnel zones 
  will be some multiple of 180° out of phase with the direct wave, thereby 
  producing destructive or constructive interference as the multiple is odd or 
  even, respectively. </I>
