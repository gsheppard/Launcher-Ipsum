  <DT><STRONG>zenith</STRONG> <A name=zenith></A>
  <DD>That point of the <A 
  href="c.html#celestial sphere">celestial 
  sphere</A> vertically overhead. 
  <DD><I>The point 180 degrees from the zenith is called the nadir.</I> 
  <DT><STRONG>zenithal</STRONG> 
  <DD>Of or pertaining to the <A 
  href="z.html#zenith">zenith</A>. 
  <DT><STRONG>zenith attraction</STRONG> 
  <DD>The effect of the earth's gravity on a <A 
  href="m.html#meteoric">meteoric</A> body, 
  which increases the velocity and moves the <A 
  href="r.html#radiant">radiant</A> toward 
  the <A href="z.html#zenith">zenith</A>. 
  <A name="zenith distance"></A>
  <DT><STRONG>zenith distance</STRONG> 
  <DD>Angular distance from the zenith; the arc of a <A 
  href="v.html#vertical circle">vertical 
  circle</A> between the zenith and a point on the <A 
  href="c.html#celestial sphere">celestial 
  sphere</A>, measured from the zenith through 90 degrees, for bodies above the 
  horizon. 
  <DD><I>This is the same as colatitude with reference to the celestial 
  horizon.</I> 
  <DT><STRONG>zenographic</STRONG> 
  <DD>Referring to positions on Jupiter measured in <A 
  href="l.html#latitude">latitude</A> from 
  Jupiter's equator and in <A 
  href="l.html#longitude">longitude</A> 
  from a reference meridian. <A name=zero></A>
  <DT><STRONG>zero gravity</STRONG> = weightlessness. 
  <DT><STRONG>zero-g </STRONG>= weightlessness. 
  <DT><STRONG>zero launch</STRONG> 
  <DD>The launch of a rocket or aircraft by a <A 
  href="z.html#zero-length launcher">zero-length 
  launcher</A>. 
  <DT><STRONG>zero-length launcher</STRONG> <A name="zero-length launcher"></A>
  <DD>A <A 
  href="l.html#launcher">launcher</A> that 
  holds a vehicle in position and releases the rocket simultaneously at two 
  points so that the buildup of <A 
  href="t.html#thrust">thrust</A>, normally 
  rocket thrust, is sufficient to take the missile or vehicle directly into the 
  air without need of a take-off run and without imposing a pitch rate release. 
  <DD><I>The term is not normally applied to a pad used for a vertical 
  launch.</I> 
  <DT><STRONG>zero-length rocket</STRONG> 
  <DD>A <A href="r.html#rocket">rocket</A> 
  with sufficient thrust to launch a vehicle directly into the air. 
  <DD><I>Said especially of a rocket used to launch an aerodynamic vehicle.</I> 
  <DT><STRONG>zero-lift chord</STRONG> 
  <DD>A <A href="c.html#chord">chord</A> 
  taken through the trailing edge of an <A 
  href="a.html#airfoil">airfoil</A> in the 
  direction of the relative wind when the airfoil is at a zero-lift angle of 
  attack. 
  <DT><STRONG>zeta machine</STRONG> 
  <DD>An experimental <A 
  href="t.html#thermonuclear">thermonuclear</A> 
  device which generates a <A 
  href="p.html#plasma">plasma</A> inside a 
  torus and employs the <A 
  href="p.html#pinch effect">pinch 
  effect</A> for heating and compression. 
  <DT><STRONG>zip fuel</STRONG> 
  <DD>A boron-base high-energy <A 
  href="l.html#liquid propellant">liquid 
  propellant</A>. <A name=zodiac></A>
  <DT><STRONG>zodiac</STRONG> 
  <DD>The band of the sky extending 8 degrees either side of the <A 
  href="e.html#ecliptic">ecliptic</A>. 
  <DD><I>The Sun, Moon, and navigational planets are always within this band, 
  with the occasional exception of Venus. The zodiac is divided into 12 equal 
  parts, called signs, each part being named for the principal constellation 
  originally within it.</I> 
  <DT><STRONG>zodiacal counterglow</STRONG> = gegenschein. <A 
  name="zodiacal light"></A>
  <DT><STRONG>zodiacal light</STRONG> 
  <DD>A faint cone of light extending upward from the horizon in the direction 
  of the <A 
  href="e.html#ecliptic">ecliptic</A> 
  (zodiac). It is seen from tropical latitudes for a few hours after sunset or 
  before sunrise. 
  <DD><I>The spectrum of the zodiacal light is similar to that of sunlight, so 
  it has been suggested that it is due to the scattering of sunlight by 
  extraterrestrial dust particles. Some scattering is also due to electrons. 
  </I><A name="zone time"></A>
  <DT><STRONG>zone time</STRONG> 
  <DD>See <A href="t.html#time">time</A>. 
  <DT><STRONG>z-time</STRONG> = Greenwich mean time.
