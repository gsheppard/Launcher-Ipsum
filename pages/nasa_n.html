  Almanac Office, Royal Greenwich Observatory, listing the Greenwich hour angle 
  and declination of various <A

  bodies</A> to a precision of 0.1 minute of arc at hourly intervals; time of 
  sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset; and other astronomical information useful

  <DT><STRONG>nautical mile</STRONG> 
  <DD>A unit of distance used principally in navigation. For practical

  the great circle most commonly used. Also called <I>sea mile. </I>
  <DD><I>Because of various lengths of the nautical mile in use throughout the 
  world, due to differences in definition and the assumed size and shape of the 
  earth, the International Hydrographic Bureau in 1929 proposed a standard 
  length of 1852 meters, which is known as the international nautical mile. This 
  has been adopted by nearly all maritime nations. The U.S. Departments of 
  Defense and Commerce adopted this value on July 1, 1954. With the yard-meter 
  relationship then in use, the international nautical mile was equivalent to 
  6076.10333 feet. Using the yard-meter conversion factor effective July 1, 
  1959, the international nautical mile is equivalent to 6076.11549 
  international feet. </I>

  <DD>A set of three fundamental postulates forming the basis of the mechanics

  <DD><I>The first law is concerned with the principle of inertia and states 
  that if a body in motion is not acted upon by an external force, its momentum 
  remains constant (law of conservation of momentum). The second law asserts 
  that the rate of change of momentum of a body and is in the direction of the 
  applied force. A familiar statement of this is the equation F = ma where F is 
  vector sum of the applied forces, m is the mass, and a is the vector 
  acceleration of the body. The third law is the principle of action and 
  reaction, stating that for every force acting upon a body there exists a
